# üìä Techtronix Innovations Data Analytics Project  

This portfolio highlights my work in analyzing complex business data, uncovering actionable insights, and creating impactful visualizations to support strategic decision-making for Techtronix Innovations, a microchip and robotics industry leader.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Context  

**Techtronix Innovations** faced key business challenges, including:  
- Optimizing sales strategies to improve performance across regions and product categories.  
- Enhancing inventory management to reduce mismatches between production and demand.  
- Identifying profitable opportunities for market expansion.  

I analyzed the company's transactional, customer, and financial data to address these issues using Power BI. I also delivered a suite of dashboards and reports that provided clarity on their sales performance, customer behaviour, and profitability metrics.

## üîç Scope of Work  

### **1. Sales Performance Analysis**  
- **Insights Uncovered**:  
  - Microchips were the top-performing category.  
  - The APAC region led in sales volume, driven by strong demand in consumer electronics, whereas North America lagged, highlighting an opportunity for growth.  
  - Sales peaked in April, with a notable dip in May, indicating a need for strategies to maintain momentum post-peak season.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Used Power BI to analyze sales data across regions, product categories, and timeframes.  
  - Created trend visualizations to identify patterns and best/worst performers.

### **2. Customer Insights**  
- **Insights Uncovered**:  
  - Customers in the Industrial and Consumer Electronics sectors accounted for 69% of total sales, with microchips being the most preferred product.  
  - APAC dominated customer distribution, while North America showed significant untapped potential.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Conducted segmentation analysis by sector and geography.  
  - Used heatmaps and pie charts to visualize customer distribution and preferences.

### **3. Inventory Optimization**  
- **Insights Uncovered**:  
  - Overstocking of Robotics products and stockouts of high-demand Sensors created inefficiencies.  
  - Seasonal trends revealed production planning mismatches.  
- **Proposed Solutions**:  
  - Implemented demand forecasting models to predict seasonal sales trends better.  
  - Designed real-time inventory dashboards to monitor stock levels.

### **4. Profitability Analysis & Market Expansion Opportunities**  
- **Insights Uncovered**:  
  - Q1 profitability trends inversely mirrored Q4, likely due to holiday discounts or increased production costs.
  - North America and the Industrial sector showed significant growth potential.  
  - Robotics and Sensors emerged as key focus areas for market penetration.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Evaluated revenue and production cost data across product categories.  
  - Highlighted profitability metrics using KPIs and comparative charts.
  - Conducted geographic and sectoral opportunity analysis using Power BI.  
  - Recommended targeted marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships.
